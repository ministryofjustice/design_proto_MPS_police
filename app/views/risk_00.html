        These questions are designed to ensure the safety of the detainee and anyone they come into contact with when they leave police custody.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should base your answers on the detaineeâ€™s:
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>PNC warnings</li>
          <li>risk assessment</li>
          <li>behaviour and demeanour while in custody</li>
          <li>third party information</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have access to any other relevant risk information about the detainee (including previous offences), please include it.
